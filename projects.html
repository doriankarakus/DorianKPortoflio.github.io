                    <p>Utilized DFS and BFS search algorithms to find links between artificially created users via
                        mutual friends simulated a way for friends to meet mutual friends within social media sites such
                        as Facebook. As part of a small group, I didn’t have a specific set of responsibilities but
                        worked with my team to organize and complete steps towards the project’s development.</p>

                    <p>Part of a team that created an interactive character (“Buddy”) that users could interact and play
                        with to take needed study breaks using SDL2, Windows API and our UI, a user could play with
                        (“Buddy”) and set the timer easily. My role in this project was centered around timer
                        functionality, assistance with Buddy’s character development and organization of tasks of all
                        members.</p>

                        role in coding and provided an equal contribution to the physical electro-mechanical
                        development. Our combined efforts led to Locus Technology LLC being awarded as a Top 21 National

                    <p>As a member of a three-person development team, I contributed to the creation of a mood-based
                        music generation platform, which curates personalized playlists aligned with the user's selected
                        mood. The project employed the ReactJS framework in conjunction with the Spotify Web API to
                        access and modify users' Spotify playlists. My primary responsibility involved leading the
                        frontend design and implementation. Additionally, I conducted user testing and performed a
                        comprehensive analysis of user data collected from our peers, facilitating enhancements to
                        address the application's deficiencies.</p>

                        challenging 2D platformer utilizing the Godot engine. My responsibilities within this
                        collaborative effort encompassed a diverse range of tasks essential to the game's development
                        lifecycle. These tasks included initial game design conceptualization, digital asset
                        aggregation, development of fundamental movement mechanics and physics interactions, creation of
                        multiple level designs, and various supplementary activities.</p>
